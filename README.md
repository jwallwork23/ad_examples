## Automatic differentiation applied to some time-dependent PETSc examples

Based on various tutorials and pieces of code taken from the following projects:
* PETSc: https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/
* ADOL-C: https://projects.coin-or.org/ADOL-C
* Tapenade: https://www-sop.inria.fr/tropics/tapenade.html
* Netlib BLAS: http://www.netlib.org/blas/

Majority of code is work done in those projects, with some small modifications. All work done in making these modifications forms part of an internship at Argonne National Laboratory (https://www.anl.gov/).
