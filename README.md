## Automatic differentiation applied to some time-dependent PETSc examples

Based on various tutorials taken from the following projects:
* PETSc: https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/
* ADOL-C: https://projects.coin-or.org/ADOL-C
* Tapenade: https://www-sop.inria.fr/tropics/tapenade.html

Majority of code is work done in those projects, with some small modifications. All work done in making these modifications forms part of an internship at Argonne National Laboratory (https://www.anl.gov/).
