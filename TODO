Things which would be nice if implemented properly:
* Hand-coded matrix-free Jacobian vector product for Gray-Scott.
* Zero order scalar (ZOS) test to check ADOL-C evaluates function correctly.
* Register external functions in power grid example, so that MatMult is differentiated appropriately.
* Demonstrate ADOL-C - Tapenade or ADOL-C - ADIC interface.
